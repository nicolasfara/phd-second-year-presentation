= Background and Research Context

== Collective Systems in the Wearable Edge-Cloud Continuum

#components.side-by-side(columns: (2fr, auto))[
  #underline[Collective systems] are large-scale systems composed of several
  #bold[interconnected devices] that interact and collaborate to
  achieve *global common goals*.

  Traditionally, collective systems are considered as a "flat" network of devices, but the emergence of #bold[wearable devices] and the #bold[edge-cloud continuum] opens new research challenges and opportunities.

  In this new domain, the network is *highly heterogeneous* in terms of device capabilities, and the #bold[network topology] is #underline[dynamic], #underline[unpredictable], and #underline[multi-level].

]

== Research Topics

#components.side-by-side(columns: (2fr, auto))[
  // To exploit the *potential* of collective systems in the wearable edge-cloud continuum, my research focuses on #bold[three] main topics:

  === Languages
  Designing #underline[domain-specific languages], #underline[type systems], and #underline[LLMs] to provide *high-level abstractions* for engineering _Collective Systems_.

  === Reconfiguration
  Developing #underline[adaptive] and #underline[resilient] algorithms for the *self-management* of _Collective Adaptive Systems_ in the Cloud-Edge Continuum.

  === Infrastructure and Deployment
  Developing #underline[efficient] and #underline[scalable] infrastructure solutions for *deploying* and *managing* _CASs_ in the _ECC_.

== Infrastructure and Deployment

#components.side-by-side(columns: (2fr, auto))[
  I implemented a *middleware* based on the pulverization partitioning model #cite(label("DBLP:journals/fgcs/FarabegoliPCV24")) showing how it can trade-offs between #bold[energy consumption] and #bold[infrastructure cost].

  I then proposed an orthogonal, and more general, model #cite(label("DBLP:conf/acsos/FarabegoliVC24")) where the devices are represented as both *local* and *collective* components that can be deployed independently over the infrastructure.

  The model has been #bold[formalized] and proved to be #underline[functional equivalent] to the analogous "flat" deployment. Moreover, energy efficiency and convergence time have been *evaluated through simulations* showing benefits over traditional approaches.
  // I proposed a #underline[partitioned macro-programming model] to program collective systems in the wearable edge-cloud continuum.

  // The model allows developers to define #bold[logical components] that can be #bold[deployed] on different nodes of the continuum, based on their capabilities and the application requirements.

  // I also developed a #underline[middleware] that implements the proposed model, providing mechanisms for #bold[component deployment], #bold[communication], and #bold[adaptation] to dynamic changes in the network topology.

== Intelligent Reconfiguration

I applied *macro-programming* techniques to develop a #underline[decentralized] and #underline[self-organizing] algorithm for the reconfiguration of collective systems in cloud-edge infrastructures #cite(label("DBLP:journals/iot/FarabegoliPCV24")).

In this work, I simulated #underline[large-scale], #underline[variable topology] networks to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by varying the #bold[infrastructure load], and considering #bold[node failures] and #bold[recoveries]. The approach *significantly outperforms* solutions that consider local reconfiguration rules.

#pagebreak()

#components.side-by-side(columns: (2fr, auto))[
  I also investigated the problem of #bold[automatic reconfiguration plan synthesis] for collective systems in cloud-edge infrastructures.

Starting from the pulverization model, I proposed and *prolog-based planner* to automatically derive #bold[reconfiguration plans] that adapt the deployment of collective systems to changes in the infrastructure and application requirements #cite(label("DBLP:conf/coordination/BrogiCFFV25")).

The approach has been evaluated in terms of #bold[carbon footprint] showing *significant improvements* compared to deployment on "flat" infrastructures.

#figure(image("images/alchemist-prolog.svg", height: 60%))

#pagebreak()

To deal with heterogeneity of the #underline[infrastructure], I proposed a *graph neural network* model to learn #bold[reconfiguration policies] for collective systems such infrastructure #cite(label("DBLP:conf/woa/DominiFAV24")).

This model can #underline[adapt to changes] in the infrastructure and application requirements. Moreover, such approach is *fully distributed* and can *scale to large infrastructures*.

#figure(image("images/gnn-ac-marl.svg", height: 50%))

== Languages

Designing and engineering #bold[collective systems] is notoriously difficult even if *domain-specific languages* have been proposed to #underline[abstract low-level details].

I proposed an approach based on *large language models* to support developers in programming collective systems #cite(label("10.1145/3758326")). The approach has been evaluated with different LLMs and programming tasks in designing collective systems showing #bold[promising results].

#components.side-by-side(columns: (2fr, auto))[
  The approach uses a #bold[BoK] (Body of Knowledge) to guide the LLM in generating code in which the #underline[domain expert] knowledge is embedded.

  A #underline[test suite] is then used to validate the generated code and provide feedback to the LLM for further refinement.

== Type Systems and Real Deployments

#components.side-by-side(columns: (1fr, 1fr))[
  === Type Systems for better CAS

  I'm currently working on a *type system* for integrating #bold[collective specification] with other distributed approaches such as #underline[choreographies] and #underline[multitier] programming.

  The unifying mechanism lies in the concept of *placement types* that allows to specify (at type-leve) where the computation should be performed in the infrastructure,
  and to check statically that the program is #bold[deployment-consistent].

  #v(2em)

  === Real Deployments of CAS

  I'm also working on *close the gap* between #bold[simulations] and #bold[real deployments] of collective systems.

  Such systems are usually #bold[evaluated through simulation]. However, real deployments are crucial to understand the *practical challenges* and *validate the effectiveness* of the proposed solutions in #underline[real-world scenarios].

  To this aim, I'm designing a *low-cost testbed* based on #underline[rovers] to deploy and evaluate collective systems in real-world scenarios.
